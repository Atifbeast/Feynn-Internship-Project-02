McDonald's employs a strategic approach to segment its target market into distinct groups, allowing the company to customize its marketing strategies, products, and services to cater to the specific preferences and needs of each segment. The case study delves into McDonald's fast food market, focusing on customer demographics such as gender, age, and monthly purchasing patterns. Implementing market segmentation is not a short-term endeavor; rather, it requires a substantial and enduring commitment from the organization. It involves strategic decisions, financial considerations, organizational adjustments, and the active engagement of top leadership to maximize its benefits as a pivotal strategy for the organization's growth.

My job was to do segment extraction where we do market segmentation(cluster analysis) and categorize consumers into different categories. Segement Extraction deals with various clustering methods like hirarchical, distance based(partitioning method), hard compititive learning, model based, hybrid learning ... etc.
